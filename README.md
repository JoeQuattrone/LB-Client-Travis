## What LyricBunny Is
LyricBunny is a lyric-searching website. Type in the name of any song and LyricBunny will find and present its lyrics (30% of the lyrics due to MusixMatch's API license). In addition to presenting lyrics, LyricBunny offers a "like" functionality that persists to the [LB-API-Travis](https://github.com/JoeQuattrone/LB-API-Travis) database. This feature allows LyricBunny to store data for the "most liked songs" and present it. The [LB-API-Travis](https://github.com/JoeQuattrone/LB-API-Travis) repo is essential for the full functionality of LyricBunny so you will be asked to clone it in the upcoming directions.

## Why I Built It
I built this application to implement a wide-range of my skills as a React developer in a fun and practical way. LyricBunny showcases many features and technologies of React Development. It contains technologies such as:

* `React-Router` - routing in React
* `Redux` - global state management
* `Thunk` - asynchronous dispatching
* `Jest` - Unit/Integration testing

Along with many more technologies.
